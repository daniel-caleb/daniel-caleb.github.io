As a dedicated Information Security and Forensics student at KCA University, I am on a journey to explore the dynamic field of cybersecurity. My academic journey is complemented by practical expertise gained from a Full Stack Software Development certificate at eMobilis Technology Training Institute (MIT).

 My hands-on experience in software development methodologies, version control, and collaborative coding practices has equipped me to design, build, and deploy robust and scalable full-stack solutions.
