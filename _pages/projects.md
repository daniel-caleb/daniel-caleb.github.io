## 🌩️ AWS Cloud Resume Challenge *(Completed)*

**Description:**  
The [AWS Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) is a hands-on project designed to showcase cloud skills by building and deploying a resume website using various AWS services. The challenge involves creating a resume in HTML and CSS, hosting it as a static website on Amazon S3, securing it with HTTPS via CloudFront, and linking it to a custom domain. Additionally, it includes setting up a visitor counter using JavaScript, DynamoDB, and a serverless API with AWS Lambda and API Gateway. The project also emphasizes automation with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS SAM or Terraform, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions. This challenge is a comprehensive way to demonstrate proficiency in cloud technologies and best practices in a real-world scenario

**Highlights:**  

- ***Quick File Upload***: Upload files to a specified S3 bucket with a single command.
- ***Target Directory Support***: Optionally specify a target directory within the S3 bucket.
- ***Error Handling***: Provides meaningful error messages for incorrect or missing inputs.
- ***Secure Handling of AWS Credentials***: Uses the AWS CLI for secure authentication and avoids hardcoding credentials.
